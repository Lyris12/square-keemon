# Square-k√©mon

Usage:
```
<Square [size=String] [direction=string] [smooth]>
```
`size` := How long each side of this Square will be
`direction` := In which direction(s) the rainbow gradient will flow
`smooth` := Whether the rainbow gradient will be rendered with parallel or perpendicular separators
* `direction` Usable letters:
```
H := Horizontal
V := Vertical
D := Diagonal
L := Left to Right
T := Top to Bottom
R := Right to Left
B := Bottom to Top
```
* No spacing nor separation is required
* ! It is **not** recommended to put `L` and `R` in the same direction string, nor `T` and `B`
* `H` & `V` do not work with `smooth`
